  summary: >
    I have a strong history in academia and aim to apply my research and
    analytical skills to different roles.

    A hardworking self-starter, I approach my work utilizing a blend of research skills, creative flair, critical

    thinking, and analytical abilities. Through the various projects I have completed during my 

    academic career, I've cultivated verbal and written communication skills through presentations

    and written publications, created sustainable relationships with informants, and managed various forms

    of human feedback including audio recordings, video recordings, and surveys. I have also learned the value

    of teamwork by collaborating with others in different states and countries to co-create publications and information

    technology resources. My experiences have provided me with a strong sense of self-discipline and

    motivation in organizing my own work schedule, excellent organizational skills, and meticulous attention to 

    detail. I also have experience in digesting data with the goal of finding significant patterns in order to

    improve efficiency and effectiveness.
